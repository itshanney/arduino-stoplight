Overview
========
The Arduino Stoplight is my first foray into using the very popular Arduino electronics prototyping board.  
After being inspired by this really good use of a [traffic signal](http://urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens/2010/05/19/the_github_stoplight/) 
I decided to use the Arduino to power the traffic signal that I had sitting in my attic.

This repository is the result of my efforts of coding and soldering to produce a working traffic signal powered by Arduino.
